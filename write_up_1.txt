For this recipe, it will be necessary to download nmap and dirb utilities.

nmap is a network tool usefull to scan an IP and find a lot of data about running services etc.

dirb is a web content scanner used to find any hidden or existing web files and directories.
dirb is included in Kali distribution. It will be easier and practical to set up another VM with Kali on it to carry on.

curl is another way to retrive information with the -k flag to bypass trust chain checks but I could'nt find the other web pages without dirb.

1) Find your IP range:

ip a

2) You will find your IP with the CIDR range. Usually /24
scan your IP with nmap and display the list of running services:

nmap -sL <your_IP>

in the list you will find the boot2root server with the corresponding IP:

In my case:
"Nmap scan report for borntosechackme.home (192.168.1.29)"

3) scan the boot2root server with nmap. I chose to use -A flag. it stand for agressive scan. This way, a lot of informations will be displayed.
Interesting informations like expired ssl certification will be displayed, the services versions etc.

nmap -A Nmap <BOOT2ROOT_IP>

4) Here you can see a list of open port with the corresponding versions.
- Appache
- openssh
- vsftpd
etc

5) Before searching for known vulnerabilities for theses versions, lets use dirb on our bornToSecHackMe IP

dirb https://192.168.1.29/

Here, you will see some interesting pages:
<IP>/forum
<IP>/forum/js
<IP>/forum/templates_c
<IP>/phpmyadmin
<IP>/webmail

Each page have some interesting things to look. But before any code, we will read the content of the forum.

6) Type on the nav bar: https://<BOOT2ROOT_IP>/forum
 
The forum is a good place to try the "social engineering" method.
The obvious thread is: "problem login?"
Here, we can see sshd logs of connexion attempts.
There is a lot of hints and usefull information:

t 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2
Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Received disconnect from 161.202.39.38: 3: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Auth fail [preauth]
Oct 5 08:46:01 BornToSecHackMe CRON[7549]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user lmezard by (uid=1040)

The first line is a mistake: the password was entered instead of the username. 
Then we can see the user who made the mistake, line 3 : lmezard

7) Unfortunately, this pair user/password won't let us connect on the BornToSec server.
However, we can connect on the website.

8) Here, we can find lmezard's email by clicking on the user name after log in.

9) With this email and the previous password, we can log to the webmail on the page https://<BOOT2ROOT_IP>/webmail

10) There is a mail with the object "DB ACCESS". There is a password for root user.
But it is not the ssh credentials yet. It is a way to access the web DB.

11) On https://<BOOT2ROOT_IP>/phpmyadmin, use root as ID and the password given in the mail.
